<p>This semester, we will be using Piazza for class discussions. If you have a question that may be of general interest to your fellow students, please post it on Piazza rather than emailing me directly. This allows others to answer your question or benefit from my answer. I will check the Piazza forum regularly and respond as quickly as I can. To access Piazza, log into&#160;<a href="https://canvas.jmu.edu/courses/1446875">Canvas</a>&#160;and click the "Piazza" link in the navigation bar on the left.&#160;</p>
<p>Class grades will be accessible via&#160;<a href="https://canvas.jmu.edu" title="Canvas">Canvas</a>, and online quizzes will be administered using Canvas as well.&#160;</p>
