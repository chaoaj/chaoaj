## About Me

![Photo of my family](family.jpg)
I am Alvin Chao. This website is a gathering of links that I like, my Computer Science course pages, Music I enjoy, Bible study material, and other things that interest me.

I am an Adjunct Instructor for Computer Science, Collaborative Service Manager at JMU, member at [Church of the Incarnation](https://theincarnation.org) and a husband and father.
